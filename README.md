# Classification-Regression-analysis-in-Scikit-learn-
This repository will contain the basics of implementation of classification and regression analysis from data preprocessing till visualization and predictions

I have attached here both classification and regression dataset - Both test and train in two separate folders.

Please note that these are basic level of analysis in python using simple machine learning lib. So it will be useful for beginners to start practising with data science coding.
